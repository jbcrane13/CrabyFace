# ViewModels/Features Directory
# 
# This directory should contain feature-specific ViewModels:
# - LoginViewModel.swift (login screen logic)
# - RegisterViewModel.swift (registration logic)
# - HomeViewModel.swift (home screen state management)
# - ProfileViewModel.swift (user profile management)
# - SettingsViewModel.swift (app settings logic)
# - SearchViewModel.swift (search functionality)
# - DetailViewModel.swift (detail view logic)
# 
# Each ViewModel should:
# - Inherit from ObservableObject
# - Use @Published for observable state
# - Contain no SwiftUI imports (only Combine/Foundation)
# - Handle all business logic for its associated View
