# Phase 1: Enhanced Dashboard - Files to Add to Xcode Project

## Instructions
Please add the following files to the Xcode project in their appropriate groups:

### Models Group
1. `JubileeMobileBay/Models/WeatherData.swift`
2. `JubileeMobileBay/Models/MarineData.swift`
3. `JubileeMobileBay/Models/PredictionModels.swift`

### Services/Protocols Group (create if needed)
1. `JubileeMobileBay/Services/Protocols/URLSessionProtocol.swift`
2. `JubileeMobileBay/Services/Protocols/WeatherAPIProtocol.swift`
3. `JubileeMobileBay/Services/Protocols/MarineDataProtocol.swift`

### Services Group
1. `JubileeMobileBay/Services/WeatherAPIService.swift`
2. `JubileeMobileBay/Services/MarineDataService.swift`
3. `JubileeMobileBay/Services/PredictionService.swift`

### Test Files - Models Group
1. `JubileeMobileBayTests/Models/WeatherDataTests.swift`
2. `JubileeMobileBayTests/Models/MarineDataTests.swift`

### Test Files - Services Group
1. `JubileeMobileBayTests/Services/WeatherAPIServiceTests.swift`
2. `JubileeMobileBayTests/Services/MarineDataServiceTests.swift`
3. `JubileeMobileBayTests/Services/PredictionServiceTests.swift`

## Steps to Add Files:
1. In Xcode, right-click on the appropriate group
2. Select "Add Files to JubileeMobileBay..."
3. Navigate to the file location
4. Ensure "Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED (files already exist)
5. Ensure the correct target membership is selected:
   - Main app files → JubileeMobileBay target
   - Test files → JubileeMobileBayTests target
6. Click "Add"

## Notes:
- All files have been created following TDD-MVVM architecture
- Tests are written first, then implementations
- API services use protocol-based dependency injection for testability
- Models are pure data structures with no UI dependencies
