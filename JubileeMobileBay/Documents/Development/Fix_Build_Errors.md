# Fix Core ML Build Errors

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **Modified CoreMLPredictionService.swift**:
   - Changed from generic `MLModel` to typed `JubileePredictor` class
   - Updated model loading to use `JubileePredictor(contentsOf:configuration:)`
   - Updated prediction call to use `prediction(input:)` instead of `prediction(from:)`
   - Updated output processing to use `JubileePredictorOutput` instead of `MLFeatureProvider`

2. **Removed Conflicting Files**:
   - Deleted `JubileePredictorModel.swift` which was conflicting with auto-generated code

## Remaining Manual Steps in Xcode

### Remove Missing File Reference
1. Open `JubileeMobileBay.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. In the Project Navigator, find the red (missing) reference to `JubileePredictorModel.swift`
3. Right-click on it and select "Delete"
4. Choose "Remove Reference" (not "Move to Trash" since the file is already deleted)

### Verify Core ML Integration
1. Ensure `JubileePredictor.mlpackage` is properly added to the project
2. Check that it has target membership for `JubileeMobileBay`
3. Build the project (âŒ˜+B)

## How the Core ML Integration Works

The Core ML integration now uses:
1. **JubileePredictor.mlpackage**: The placeholder Core ML model
2. **Auto-generated JubileePredictor.swift**: Created by Xcode from the model
3. **CoreMLPredictionService**: Uses the typed `JubileePredictor` class

The system automatically generates:
- `JubileePredictorInput` class with properties for environmental data
- `JubileePredictorOutput` class with prediction results
- `JubileePredictor` class for model loading and prediction

## Testing the Integration

After removing the missing file reference, the build should succeed. The Core ML model will use the placeholder implementation until a real model is trained in subtask 1.2.
