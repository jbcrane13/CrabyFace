## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Maps**: MapKit + CoreLocation
- **Video**: AVFoundation (HLS streaming)
- **Persistence**: CloudKit + Core Data
- **Real-time**: Starscream WebSocket
- **UI**: SwiftUI with UIKit integration
- **Push**: Apple Push Notification Service

### Key Dependencies
```swift
// Podfile additions
pod 'Starscream', '~> 4.0'  // WebSocket client
pod 'MarkdownUI', '~> 2.0'  // Rich text editing
pod 'Kingfisher', '~> 7.0'  // Image caching
```

### Architecture Patterns
- MVVM for all new features
- Protocol-oriented design for services
- Combine for reactive data flow
- Async/await for network calls

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Camera Feed Sources**
   - Risk: Partnerships with providers
   - Mitigation: Start with public feeds, add private later

2. **Real-time Scalability**
   - Risk: WebSocket server load
   - Mitigation: Start with polling, upgrade to WebSocket

3. **Content Moderation**
   - Risk: Inappropriate content
   - Mitigation: CloudKit moderation, user reporting

### Timeline Risks
- Build buffer time between phases
- Each phase independently shippable
- MVP approach for each feature
