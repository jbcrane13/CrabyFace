# Services/Mocks Directory
# 
# This directory should contain mock implementations for testing:
# - MockAuthService.swift (for testing authentication flows)
# - MockNetworkService.swift (for testing network requests)
# - MockDataService.swift (for testing data operations)
# - MockLocationService.swift (for testing location features)
# - Any other mock services used in unit tests and UI tests
# 
# Mock services should conform to the same protocols as real implementations
# and provide controllable, predictable behavior for testing
