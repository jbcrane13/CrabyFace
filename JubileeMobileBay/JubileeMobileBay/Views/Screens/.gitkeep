# Views/Screens Directory
# 
# This directory should contain full screen views:
# - LoginView.swift (login screen)
# - RegisterView.swift (registration screen)
# - HomeView.swift (main home screen)
# - ProfileView.swift (user profile screen)
# - SettingsView.swift (app settings screen)
# - DetailView.swift (item detail screen)
# - SearchView.swift (search screen)
# - OnboardingView.swift (first-time user flow)
# 
# Screen views should:
# - Compose smaller components together
# - Bind to their respective ViewModels
# - Handle navigation and screen-level layout
# - Adapt to iPad vs iPhone layouts when needed
